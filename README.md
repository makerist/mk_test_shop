# Makerist test shop app

This app scaffold is generated by [orats](https://github.com/nickjj/orats).


### Setup

1. Read the .env file carefully and change any user specific settings, such
    as e-mail credentials and platform specific settings (check the comments).

2. Build and run the project with Docker Compose
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Reset and Migrate the database (run this in a 2nd Docker-enabled terminal)
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec website rails db:reset
    docker-compose exec website rails db:migrate
    ```
    Linux users have to set the user flag:
    ```
    docker-compose exec --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" website rails db:reset
    docker-compose exec --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" website rails db:migrate
    ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`


### Developing

1. Start the whole app `docker-compose up`

2. Development as usual

    Make code changes. Reload page.

    If you have to run any tasks inside the container use `docker-compose exec <service-name> <cmd>`:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec website rails db:migrate
    ```

    To open a console in a container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec website sh
    ```

3. Stop all services
    1. Variant a: run in a separate terminal window (same directory) to clean up all:
       `docker-compose up`
    2. Variant b: press `Ctrl+C` in the running terminal (containers are not removed)

### Troubleshooting

1. If you get an rack time-out error, set the env var `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` to `20` in `.env`. 
   It's caused by the assets compiling running for the first time.
